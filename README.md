### The purpose of this project is to learn how to use JS. The object was to write code for creating aplication for notation for books that the user has, has read or is reading. In my application, you can add new book by entering some book with title longer than 4 characters, name of the author longer than 6 characters.
 

- Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has
properties for the title (a string), author (a string), maxPages(int) and
onPage(int) . maxPages is the number of pages the book has. onPage is a
number that represents the page that we are on.
- Iterate through the array of books. For each book, make a list with the book
title and book author like so: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien".
- Now use an if/else statement to change the output depending on whether
you read it yet or not (check if maxPages is equal to onPage). If you read it, list
it in format 'You already read "The Hobbit" by J.R.R. Tolkien in green text', and
if not, 'You still need to read "The Lord of the Rings" by J.R.R. Tolkien. in red
text.'
- Make a table and populate it with info about the books. Next to every book
there should be a progress bar. Calculate the percentage of how far away you
are in the book and show it through the progress bar.
- Under the table, make a form to add a new object (or add the values to the
object through multiple prompts). After clicking submit, the object should be
automatically added to the table together with the progress bar.
